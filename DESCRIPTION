Description: Local congregations of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
  Saints use Member and Leader Services (MLS) to coordinate membership records
  with Church headquarters.  The ldsmls package uses the information in 
  MLS to provide additional local utilities for the congregations that are 
  not offered by the MLS application.
